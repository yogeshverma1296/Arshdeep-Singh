With a bachelor's degree, I am eager to advance my career in Linux administration and cloud computing. My academic background has equipped me with a solid understanding of Linux systems and their optimization.

My skills extend to cloud platform such as AWS, where I am adept at deploying and managing cloud-based applications. I also have a keen interest in system integration.

Driven by a desire to solve complex technical problems, I excel in providing technical support and configuring network systems. My goal is to leverage these skills to contribute to innovative technology solutions.
